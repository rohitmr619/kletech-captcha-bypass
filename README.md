#  KLE Tech eResults Scraper Script

##  Automating Student Results Retrieval

### **Overview**
This script automates the process of retrieving student results from the [KLE Tech eResults](https://eresults.kletech.ac.in) portal. By leveraging a **persistent CAPTCHA token**, it allows users to fetch multiple student records efficiently.

This tool is designed for **data aggregation and analysis**, making it easier to collect academic data for legitimate purposes such as result analysis and trend observation.

---

##  **Use Case**
- **Batch Fetching**: Automates the retrieval of student results without repeated CAPTCHA solving.
- **Data Collection**: Useful for academic data analysis, grade tracking, and institutional research.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time by eliminating the need for manually entering each University Seat Number (USN).

---

##  **How the Script Works**
1. **User enters the CAPTCHA value** once at the start.
2. **Loops through all USNs** in a defined range (`01fe22bcs001` ‚Üí `01fe22bcs300`, `01fe22bci001` ‚Üí `01fe22bci300`).
3. **Reuses the same CAPTCHA** for each request.
4. **Saves each student's HTML response locally** for further analysis.
